My day job is working as the Director of Engineering for a great internet radio service called [Digitally Imported](https://di.fm), where I provide both direct management and technical leadership for our fully-remote and globally distributed web, mobile, backend, and devops engineers, where I'm focused on software development practice and building a great, sustainable engineering organization. We stream well over 100 channels of music 24/7, from trance to tango and everything in between.

I used to build teams and communities in my work as the General Manager of [Overclock.net](https://www.overclock.net), part of Wikia's family of enthusiast websites - the largest performance computing discussion board of its kind on the internet, where I directed the community, content, staff, and logistics which together helped our half a million members create and curate the content viewed over 20 million times each month.

On the side, I work as an audio engineer and design, implement, and mix on professional audio systems. I've recorded small and large ensembles in genres from opera theater to salsa orchestra, working with artists Lucie Arnaz, Tiempo Libre, and Kate Reid. I love the Yamaha DM 2000 console, MAGIX Sequoia, and Cockos Reaper. Big band holds a special place in my heart, and it was with [a big band recording](/sounds) that I was able to win Downbeat Magazine's Best Engineered Live Recording for the year 2013.
