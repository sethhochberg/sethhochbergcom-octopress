As its title might suggest, this page is dedicated to audio that I've worked with in one form or another. Things here range from recordings to one-off projects like tape restorations. More details are included with each entry below. 

##UMiami Recording Services Live Recordings

Working in the Frost School of Music's concert halls, I'm fortunate to get to work with a ton of great musicians, and especailly great jazz. I do live concert recording, and highlights from some of my recordings are below: 

#Henry Mancini Institude Orchestra - Americana - November 30th 2012

Just recently the Henry Mancini Institute Orchestra put on a concert of Americana, featuring the best of American music. This is a group of (mostly) DMA cantidates in the Frost School of Music, some of whom are also Fellows with the New World Symphony (a training program for soon-to-be orchestral player hopefulls, under the artistic direction of Michael Tilson Thomas). 

The concert opened with an original staging of Aaron Copeland's Appalachian Spring, recorded into MAGIX Seqouia through a Yamaha DM-2000 console's preamps and RME HDSP MADI interface at 24bit/96khz. Microphones were a 50cm spaced pair of DPA 4051, suspended roughly 12 feet above and 3 feet behind the conductor.

After the above Copeland performance, the Mancini Institute's big band took the stage, for a performance of the complete Duke Ellington Nutcracker (music by Tchakofsky, arranged by Ellington). This portion of the performance was mixed live, but is being remixed from the multitrack recording befor ebeing posted here. 



##Tape Restorations

A great mentor and close friend of mine's father spent much of his career as a saxophonist in various military bands, not the least of which included the Naval Academy's Next Wave, the Army Field Band's Jazz Ambassadors, and the Air Force's Airmen of Note. I digitized and cleaned up a large number of 7" tapes that these groups had recorded, mostly of their live performances, and have a few samples of the awesome quality of these groups below:
