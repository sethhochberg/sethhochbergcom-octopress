As its title might suggest, this page is dedicated to audio that I've worked with in one form or another. Things here range from recordings to one-off projects like tape restorations. More details are included with each entry below.

Working in the Frost School of Music's concert halls, I'm fortunate to get to work with a ton of great musicians, and especailly great jazz. I do live concert recording, and highlights from some of my mixes are below: 



Tape Restorations

A great mentor and close friend of mine's father spent much of his career as a saxophonist in various military bands, not the least of which included the Naval Academy's Next Wave, the Army Field Band's Jazz Ambassadors, and the Air Force's Airmen of Note. I digitized and cleaned up a large number of 7" tapes that these groups had recorded, mostly of their live performances, and have a few samples of the awesome quality of these groups below:
