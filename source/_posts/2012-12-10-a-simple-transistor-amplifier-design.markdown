As a part of my education at UMiami, I've taken a few courses that specifically apply electronics knowledge to audio applications. For a final project in one of these courses, I recently designed a pretty straightforward transistor amplifier with a peak limiter with the goals that I'd be able to build this thing (eventually) using a spare 1U rack chassis I have in storage and a nice Lundahl toroidal transformer, also in storage, that would make a great foundation for the power supply.

There is a complete writeup on the project (complete with schematics and simulations) available [here](https://d2ue6wpj4p2l5d.cloudfront.net/Hochberg_593_Final_Fall_12.pdf).
