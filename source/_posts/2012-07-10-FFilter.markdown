title: FFilter - A simple Python script for spectral filtering of audio files
---

FFilter is a project I worked on to implement spectral filtering of audio files in Python using some simple FFT libraries. Its sorta neat, give it a look! 

Example usage: 

``` bash
$ python FFilter.py -f audio.wav -o output.wav -hp 100 -lp 2000 -n 1024 
```

Use...

``` bash
$ FFilter.py --help 
```

...for a full breakdown of command line arguments.
