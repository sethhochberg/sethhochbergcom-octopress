Way back in December of 2012, the University of Miami's Henry Mancini
Orchestra and Concert Jazz Band joined together for a concert of
Americana, featuring Copland's Appalachian Spring and Duke Ellington's
arrangement of The Nutcracker. I recorded this concert and later
submitted the virtually-untouched multitrack recording from the live
show to Downbeat Magazine's Student Music Awards in the category 'Best
Engineered Live Recording'. They liked it, the recording won, and I've
meant to get it posted online in its entirety ever since.

[(a little proof, for good
measure)](http://www.downbeat.com/digitaledition/2013/DB201306/single_page_view/124.html) 

Its only taken a year and a half, but, the recordings are finally all
online, too.
